The session revolves around understanding the deployment of Scala-based applications like Play, Akka, and Lagom etc. over DCOS, a distributed OS to manage distributed systems. Key deliverables:
1. An overview of what distributed systems are and how are they helpful for deploying production grade applications (10 mins)
2. A basic understanding of DCOS; its nodes, components, basic architecture etc. (30 mins)
3. Deployment of core Scala, Play, Lagom, Akka Http [microservices] applications over DCOS (10 mins each, total 40 mins)
4. 10 mins buffer time for a future scope with DCOS.
