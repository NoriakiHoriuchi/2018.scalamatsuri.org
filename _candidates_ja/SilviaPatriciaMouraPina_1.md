Beauty is a combination of pleasing traits, albeit subjectively perceived it still can be discussed and more or less defined. Not being exclusive to art, beauty is found in other disciplines too, such as in mathematics, and in software source code. In the software community, debates about beauty / code elegance may be implicit but they are at the heart of many concerns of modern software development. We will explore how we are using functional programming to achieve beauty in code, and how does that translate to high quality software projects.
