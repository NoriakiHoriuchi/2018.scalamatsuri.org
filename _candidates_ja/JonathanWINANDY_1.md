suggestions:
  - Developers or architects who want to: 
* operate or simplify their microservices using Scala and Kafka,
* create state of the art systems based on the latest research and best practices without the costs,
* dive progressively into extensible effects from Oleg Kiselyov (using cats-eff).

Have you ever run into a scary bug, and wished that you could go back in time to build systems differently?

While microservices are more complex to operate than they monolith counterpart, they give room for architectures that allow you to fix past mistakes and prevent you from getting blindsided by future complexities.

We will see step-by-step how Scala, functional programming and Kafka help us build complex systems with:
* Unified data management,
* Root Cause Automation,
* “Time travel” & Compensation.

No prior knowledge of Monad transformation or time manipulation is required! \(^ヮ^)/
