  - who want to understand how lenses/zippers/state monad works and how it plays together
  - need to work with large immutable objects
  - dive deep into more advanced topic

Selling point of most functional languages is immutability.  It seems no brainer but the problem start when you have to _update_ deeply nested structure.
The aim of this presentation is to show efficient methods for working with immutable objects (value classes and collections)
During presentation I will  focus on two main approaches worth knowing: lenses and zippers. Explaining a bit of theory with some practical examples with my two favourite libraries: monocle, circe and cats.
