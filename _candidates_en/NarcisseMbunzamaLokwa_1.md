A key, unsolved challenge for learning with real robotic systems is the ability to acquire vision-based behaviors from raw RGB images that can generalize to new objects and new goals. We present two approaches to this goal that we plan to demonstrate: first, learning task-agnostic visual models for planning which can generalize to new objects and goals and second learning to quickly adapt to new objects and environment using meta-imitation learning. The 2 approaches seek to generalize and dynamically adapt to new settings, respectively, as we will discuss next.
