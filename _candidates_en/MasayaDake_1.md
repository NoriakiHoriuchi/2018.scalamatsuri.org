When I started using Scala for hobby and work, I started to hear people talk about typeclasses, functor, applicatives, monad, monoid etc. both at work and on Twitter. When you ask what those mean, the explanations were often difficult "wel actually ..."'s and "in category theory .."'s. One of the books that was recommended to me when I was lost, was 'Scala With Cats.'

In this session, I will go through the above terminology in my own words based on my reading of 'Scala With Cats,' so you can get the feel for them. I'll apologize in advanced for not being the most technical explanation.
