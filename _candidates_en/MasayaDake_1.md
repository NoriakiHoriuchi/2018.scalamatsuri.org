When I began using Scala for both hobby and work, I started (both at work and on Twitter) to hear people talking about typeclasses, functors, applicatives, monads, monoids etc. When I would ask what those terms meant, the explanations were often complex and difficult to understand, often including phrases such as "well actually ..." and "in category theory ...". When I was lost in this sea of explanations, one of the books that was recommended to me was 'Scala With Cats'.

In this session, I will explain the above terminology in my own words based on my reading of 'Scala With Cats'. I'll apologize in advance for not providing the most technical explanations.
