In this talk, we will explore how can we write a distributed system with Akka. We will cover distributed systems basics, how a distributed system is capable of enhanced performance and how it gives us higher availability.

Then we would start with a demonstration of a distributed system written with Akka. We will spend most of the talk discussing the demo code.

We will also cover main advantages of Akka to build distributed systems.

We will explore aspects such a latency, throughput, computing power. We will understand how Akka is capable for fault tolerance, resilience. We will explore tool set provided by Akka library. 

But distributed *has known limitations*. For example, issues with when a network is fully meshed, how many numbers of nodes which can scale we get in a cluster, how sending large data over distribution is an issue etc. What are solutions for it?
