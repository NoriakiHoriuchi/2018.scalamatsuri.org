In this talk, I will introduce the bleeding edge of metaprogramming utility
for scala.

Since scala.reflect was shipped along with scala 2.10, metaprogramming
utility for scala evolved into scala.meta, and now it is moving toward
scala.macros. Furthermore, a project named scalagen has been started to
develop a novel static code generation tool.
In this unforeseeing situation, we, as scala programmers, are required to
catch-up with the latest development status and to prepare for the
forthcoming revolution.
On the other hand, this big change offers us good opportunities to
contribute to the core functionality of scala. Even though it seems
difficult to contribute the scala compiler itself, there is a plenty of
room for us to contribute to the scala metaprogramming ecosystem.
