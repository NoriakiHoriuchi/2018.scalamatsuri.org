Until three months ago, I used be a JavaScript engineer. Now I am a Scala engineer.

In this session, I will share my own experience of getting by as a Scala engineer, how I learned it, and what I focused on to use Scala in an actual development at work. Also I'll discuss what I learned though the experience of getting started with Scala as a engineer in general.
