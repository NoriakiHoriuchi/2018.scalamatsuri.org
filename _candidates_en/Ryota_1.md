Until three months ago, I used to be a JavaScript engineer; I am now a Scala engineer.

In this session, I will share my own experience of getting started as a Scala engineer, describe how I learned the language, and discuss what I focused on to use Scala in an actual development at work. I'll also talk about, as an engineer in general,  what I learned through this experience.
