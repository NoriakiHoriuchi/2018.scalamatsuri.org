In-company payments in pixiv Inc. are built on an internal payment foundation system, which is implemented in Scala and Play Framework.
Payment systems require stability at all times, with architecture and operations that prevent incorrect transactions by reducing logical errors as much as possible.
In this session, I'll cover the benefits of using Scala in payment systems, and describe how to endorse logical correctness in tests by using dependency injection.
