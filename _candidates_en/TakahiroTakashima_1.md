Writing a program in ASCII code was common before.
However, we can now choose UTF-8 in our program and terminal.
So, we can write programs in Japanese or other languages.

In this session, I will share the following knowledge I have gained through programming in Japanese:
- Benefits of writing in your native language
- How to implement this using Scala
- Where you still need to use English
