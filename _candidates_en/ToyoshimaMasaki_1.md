Note: By Akka, I mostly mean Akka Actors here.

It is said that when confronted with unknowns, people tend to react based on their past experiences. I am coming to realize that when using Akka, as an extension of experience, many beginners are getting stuck on similar pitfalls. I first noticed them while reviewing others' code, but reflecting back, I too struggled on similar points.

Akka is a library rich in its features. There are lots of things we could discuss, but in this 10 minute session, I'd like to focus on a select few tips to start a smoother Akka life.
