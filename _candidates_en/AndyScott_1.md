What's the reader monad and what's a Kleisli arrow? Why do they have
the same implementation but go by two different names? And why should
I care?

We will answer this by exploring the conceptual and practical
differences of readers and kleislis. Expect to see simple real world
code that demonstrate the power of both constructs.

This is an introductory talk for those getting started with functional
programming and/or Scala.
