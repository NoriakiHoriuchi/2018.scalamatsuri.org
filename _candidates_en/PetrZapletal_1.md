Serverless is a hot topic in the tech industry and also a point of contention. In this talk, I’d like to discuss if it is worth to use serverless and what are its advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, I'd like to describe use cases we were considering serverless and what was the result. Lastly, I’d like to talk about how Scala fits into this. This talk should be interesting for everyone who is considering using serverless or just would like to learn more. It is a little bit more AWS focused but the understanding of the concepts should be beneficial even if you prefer a different provider.
