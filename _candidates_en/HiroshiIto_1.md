reladomo-scala is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that was announced and made opensource at the Scala Kansai Summit 2017. It's an interesting framework that wraps a Java ORM framework named Reladomo using Scala. It provides a typesafe query language and bitemporal data model support, making it a particularly powerful framework for enterprise uses.

In this session, we will learn the framework's features and uses by going through the reladomo-scala tutorial (also known as a kata) in a test-driven development (TDD) manner.
