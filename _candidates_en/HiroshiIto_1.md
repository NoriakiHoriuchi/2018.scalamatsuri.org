reladomo-scala is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that was announced and made opensource in Scala Kansai Summit 2017. It's an interesting framework that wraps a Java ORM framework named Reladomo using Scala, and provides typesafe query language, bitemporal data model support, making it particularly powerful framework for enterprise usages.

In this session, we will learn the framework's features and usages by going through the reladomo-scala tutoral, also known as kata in a test-driven development (TDD) manner.
