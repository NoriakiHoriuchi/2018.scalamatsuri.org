  - Everyone who cares about the Scala community and making it more accessible to newcomers. This is a purely philosophical talk, no engineering per se.

The Scala community has always been split in two: FP aficionados and Scala-as-a-better-Java, yet these two communities coexist happily. There is a lesson to be learned here, because we are split along a more divisive axis: language geeks pushing the language to its limit, and "blue collar" developers seeking simplicity.

I think this bifurcation of the community, if managed carefully and honestly, is a GOOD thing: we get the best of both, crazy-powerful libraries and a solid language for our day jobs! Here I'll outline the challenges I see us facing, hoping to spark a discussion around them.
