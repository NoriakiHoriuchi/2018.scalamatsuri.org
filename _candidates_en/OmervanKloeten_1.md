These days sbt is the de-facto build tool for Scala, but most of us just write the minimum viable build.sbt file, import the libraries we need (and maybe throw in some sbt-assembly) and forget about it.

In this Good Practices session, you will learn about making your build safer and more robust by making the Scala compiler work for you and through using some sbt plugins.

This talk will be quite high-level. There will be no need for prior knowledge of sbt and it should be beneficial for you even if you donâ€™t use sbt.
