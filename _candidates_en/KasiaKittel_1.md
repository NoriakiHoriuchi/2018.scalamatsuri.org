UX Forms lets customers change web-application behaviour at runtime, without service interruption, by uploading custom code. This talk will take you through how UX Forms’ architecture has evolved from using OSGi’s dynamic class loaders to programmatically driving Docker and Kubernetes to orchestrate entire container-based services on the fly. We will look at the pros and cons of each approach, the benefits and challenges encountered with Scala’s ecosystem, and the lessons learned from running dynamic customer code in production.
