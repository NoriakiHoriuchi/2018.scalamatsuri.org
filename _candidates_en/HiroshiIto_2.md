In this session, I will start with the definition of a DB access library. Then, I will compare features of representative DB access libraries such as Slick, Quill, ScalikeJDBC as well as ORM frameworks with higher level abstraction layers such as Skinny-ORM and realdomo-scala. This session focuses on easy topics for beginners who are not familiar with DB access libraries.
