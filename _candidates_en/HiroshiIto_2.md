In this session, we are going to start with discussing the definition of DB
access library, and introduce couple of popular Scala DB access libraries
such as slick, quill and ScalikeJDBC. Afterwards we'll go through several
ORM frameworks such as Skinny-ORM or reladomo-scala that are relatively
more abstract layer within DB access linbraries. This session is aimed for
biginners those who are not familiar with DB access libraries.
