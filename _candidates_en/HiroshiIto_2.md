In this session, I will start with definition of DB access library. Then I will compare features of representative DB access library such as Slick, Quill, ScalikeJDBC and ORM framework which is higher level abstraction layer such as Skinny-ORM, realdomo-scala. This session focuses on easy topics for beginners who are not familiar with DB access library.
