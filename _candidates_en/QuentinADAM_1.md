Lots of scala developers feel like a dark wizard when they use implicits, or feeling dirty in some way doing it, somehow surprised by some implicit context... This talk goal is to explain how implicit works, why, and how to use it in a good way, to convert type, configure in a typesafe way, extends libraries or to make framework able to be extensible in a typesafe and easy way. The talk is a mix of slides and real example with real-time coding.
