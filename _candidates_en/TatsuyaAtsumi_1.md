I will talk about practical knowledge of Scala (Play2) applications which run on Kubernetes.

Specifically, below is the agenda of the talk (as there are only 10 minutes, I do these quickly): 
  - Worfklow of development, automated testing, QA testing and release
  - Configuration of Play2 and SBT to run on Kubernetes
  - Kubernetes configuration
  - Monitoring and logging

I will be able to talk about practical aspects of these subjects,
as I have been the main engineer designing and implementing the cloud infrastructure
for a new service my company launched since the end of the last year.
