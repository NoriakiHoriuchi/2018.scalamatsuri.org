In this talk, I will describe practical knowledge regarding Scala (Play2) applications which run on Kubernetes.

Specifically, below is the agenda of the talk (as there are only 10 minutes, I will touch on each of these topics quickly): 
  - Worfklow of development, automated testing, QA testing and release
  - Configuration of Play2 and SBT to run on Kubernetes
  - Kubernetes configuration
  - Monitoring and logging

I am able to talk about practical aspects of these subjects because, since the end of last year, I have been the main engineer designing and implementing the cloud infrastructure for a new service my company launched using these tools.
