As a Scala development and adoption case study, I will explain how TierLine, Inc developed their current warehouse logistics system from scratch. By going through the design and source code, I will show the development benefit of introducing Scala.

In our system, we use the following opensource frameworks:
- Front end: React.js and Scala.js
- Back end: Scala, Scalatra, Scalate, ActiveModel (squeryl based)

Please join me if you are a beginner or a manager interested in the above frameworks, how different Scala is from the other languages, or how easy it is to learn. Hopefully I can show you the benefits of Scala through this case study, and lower the barrier of adoption.
