This talk consists of a comprehensive walkthrough of the microservices pattern with Akka and Cassandra. It reviews the three primary aspects to consider when developing scalable microservices:
- Separating functionality in Microservices
- Cloning nodes
- Data partitioning

For our purposes, the talk will mainly focus on this third aspect of leveraging Akka and Cassandra to achieve scalable microservices through proper data partitioning.
