The demand for a richer experience on the client side is continuously increasing. For Scala developers this used to mean that we would have to transition from generating HTML on the server side to creating APIs serving JSON and start investigating front-end frameworks like Angular and React. As a consequence we would also have to start to learn Javascript with its tools and libraries or leave the task to a dedicated front-end developer.

Luckily ScalaJS is here, mature and with a growing community. We can now create beautiful and rich front-end clients without leaving our comfort zone of strong static typing protected from javascript surprises. In this talk we will explore some of the aspects of building a Full Stack Scala application: easy communication between client and server and sharing of validation logic and data objects.
