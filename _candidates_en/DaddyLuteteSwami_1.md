Hierarchical clustering is a data analysis method that has been used for decades. Despite its widespread use, there is lack of an analytical foundation for the method. Having such foundation would both support the methods currently used and guide future improvements. This paper gives an applied algorithmic foundation for hierarchical clustering using scala. The goal of this paper is to give an analytic framework supporting observations seen in practice. This paper considers the dual of a problem framework for hierarchical clustering introduced by Dasgupta.
