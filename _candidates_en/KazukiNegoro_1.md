The microservice architecture coordinates multiple services in a loosely-coupled way, and is said to be robust against changes, highly scalable, and fault tolerant. However, many might wonder where one should start to design and implement a system using the said architecture. In this hands-on workshop, you will experience developing a chat web app that comprises of multiple services, using Lagom framework.
