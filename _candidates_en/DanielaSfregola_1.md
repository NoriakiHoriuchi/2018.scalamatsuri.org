When the data validation component in our application is not well designed, the code can quickly become not expressive enough and probably difficult to maintain.

This talk introduces Cats, a Scala library based on category theory, and some of its most interesting components for data validation. In particular, we'll discuss some options to achieve efficient and expressive data validation. 

You'll see numerous examples of how data validation can be achieved in a clean and robust way, and how you can easily integrate it in our code, without any specific knowledge of category theory.
