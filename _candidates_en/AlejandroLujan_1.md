ScalaQuest is a fun, enticing game that will take you from Zero to Hero in your path to learning Scala.
Battle Goblins, help Wizards and face all kinds of challenges to prove your worth. Start on the safe haven of plain harmless Classes and make your way to the treacherous Implicit Forests.

Our goal is to create one of the least painful ways to learn Scala. 

In this talk, we will showcase our progress with ScalaQuest, with a focus on some of the challenges we've faced, such as compiling user-submitted code with Amazon Lambdas, keeping a snappy UI and crafting effective learning material.
