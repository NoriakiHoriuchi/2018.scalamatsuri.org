Scala has a very powerful typesystem. By leveraging this expressive language of types, we can be more confident about our code and be sure that certain bugs will never occur in our programs. In this talk we will see a number of techniques with a mixed level of sophisticated-ness to exploit the rich typesystem that Scala gives us.

Join the talk if you want to learn how to spend more time developing and less time hunting bugs!
