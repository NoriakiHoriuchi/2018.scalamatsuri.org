suggestions:
  - Shows how a stateful JVM library (web3j) can be exposed as a functional programming API.
  - Shows how Scala's value objects are used to provide a type-safe API, without imposing run-time overhead.
  - Shows how to work with Ethereum from Scala.

web3j-scala is an idiomatic Scala wrapper I wrote around web3j, which is a Java 8 version of web3.js. These 3 libraries all leverage the json-rpc protocol that Ethereum clients must support. web3j is a lightweight, reactive, somewhat type-safe library for Java and Android that integrates with nodes on Ethereum blockchains. web3j-scala provides type safety and enhanced scalability over its Java and JavaScript cousins, as well as the pleasure of writing solutions in Scala.

This talk will provide insight into how Scala libraries that package other JVM libraries can be developed, and how users can work with the JVM ecosystem to derive maximum benefit from the libraries. Ethereum and JSON-RPC will be demonstrated.
