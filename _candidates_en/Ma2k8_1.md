We released a service called Study Sapuri English (a.k.a English Sapuri) 3 years ago.
When we started development for a new TOEIC course in the service, we found many specifications that did not fit well with a monolithic architecture.

In this session, I will share why we have decided to change the architecture, what we have changed, and what technologies, design, etc. we have used.
