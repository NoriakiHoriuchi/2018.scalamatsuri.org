We released a service called called Study Sapuri English (a.k.a English Sapuri) 3 years ago.
When we started development for new TOEIC course in the service, we had found a bunch of specification that does not fit with Monothilic architecture.

In this session, I will share why we have decided to change the architecture, what we have changed and technologies we use, and design, etc.
