A universal pattern for event sourcing definition will be presented. 

As constraints we will assume a set of required projections and a command interface. Based on such constraints we will find that there is a unique construction that can be mapped to all known implementations. 

A key discovery on this construction will be the fact, that transaction scopes must be defined into the universal model and are independent of any event store implementation.
